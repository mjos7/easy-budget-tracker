## Description

Welcome to Easy Budget Tracker, a progressive web application (PWA) that allows users to add expenses and deposits to their budget, regardless of whether the user is connected to the Internet or not. If the user enters transactions offline, the changes will be reflected when they're brought back online. This application uses IndexDB, Service workers, and Web Manifest for offline functionality and is deployed on Heroku.
